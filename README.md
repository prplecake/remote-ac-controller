# remote-ac-controller

The goal of this project is to create a device that can automate my
IR-controllable AC units, either using a DHT sensor or over the internet
while I'm away.

## ac-controller

The code for the MCU.

## ac-controller-web

TODO. Will be the code for the automation, and will probably run on a
Raspberry Pi.
